Example Description

This example describes how to use Timer 4 to capture pulse width.

Requirement Components:
    None

Behaviour:
This example will print out the pulse width of 32kHz pwm positive edge.

- PA12 is connected to PB4
- PA12 will generate PWM
- PB4 will capture PWM pulse width generate by PA12
